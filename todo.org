This is the to-do list for okcart. Feel free to add something with a PR.

* Features
These are things that are intended to be added to okcart

** TODO Search
   Search bar would be at the top of the site, on the header. Centered, similar to
   Amazon's.

** TODO Categories/Tags
   Already semi-implemented, but not completely

*** TODO Allow users to tag their items

*** TODO Subscribe to a tag
A user could 'subscribe' to a tag, making it appear on their homepage.

*** TODO Browse tags
Allow tag browsing. Allow for multiple tags at the same time, using +.
Example: /tags/foo would show products tagged as 'foo'.
/tags/foo+bar would show products tagged as foo or bar
/tags/foo-bar would show products tagged as foo and bar

** TODO Analytics
Using this, users can see how their product is doing.

*** TODO Record pageviews
Log only time, don't log with Do-Not-Track

*** TODO Show pageviews
Use chart.js or something similar.

*** TODO Show purchase statistics

** TODO Gifts
A user could buy an item to someone else.

*** TODO Gift to user
Would go directly to user (user has to accept)

*** TODO Gift keys
Would give a key that could be redeemed. Use PGP.

** TODO Sales
A user can temporarily reduce the price of their product

*** TODO Coupons
Price would be reduced if a coupon code is used.

** TODO Auctions
Would work similarly to ebay. The seller can set the starting price, and users
would bid until a time is reached, or a price is reached.
